Here is an optional description
This is an initial Git project to introduce myself a little and get to know my way around.
I'm in my senior year at Western Governor's University in the BSIT, Software Development Program. I like the program a lot but have been on an accelerated schedule so I don't get as much time as I would like to really dive into code and learn some of the finer points of coding. 
The program at WGU focuses on HTML5/CSS3/JS, Java, and MySQL, while touching on many other disciplines and languages such as Python, networking, hardware, project management, software engineering, etc..  
I enjoy it and hope to capitalize on my previous career experience in IC manufacturing, robotics, & automation to make the best use of my new skills.
Feel free to drop something in the feed here to say hi!

Regards;
Jacob
